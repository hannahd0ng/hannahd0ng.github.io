	<h2>Cubism</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="txt">Cubism is an art movement formed in the early 20th century by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, which redefined representation. Its intellectual approach to representing single subjects through fragmented geometric figures, which combined multiple visual perspectives, meant that Cubism discarded classical one-point perspective. The background of this movement was the modern way of life and the fluctuations of society. Objects were brought into basic geometric forms like cubes, cones, and spheres, which were then combined to achieve simultaneous viewpoints of a single subject. Objects were separated into broken planes during the Analytical Cubism phase (1908–1912) and the Synthetic Cubism phase (1912–1919), introducing original materials and more vibrant colors in the artistic expression.</p>

			<p>Picasso’s Ma Jolie (1911–12) is a prime example of Analytical Cubism. The figure of a woman is broken down into overlapping planes of muted colors and geometric shapes by Picasso (MoMA 2021). This fractured process shows the subject from various angles, and abstraction is an inevitable aspect of Cubism. The wealth of Cubism in its beginning is demonstrated by incorporating collage material that distorts the definition of painting and sculpture.</p>

			<p>La Fresnaye's The Conquest of the Air (1913) pushes Cubism beyond portraiture and still life by introducing modern themes such as technological progress. The broken depiction of an airplane, a symbol of industrialization, attests to the Cubist interest in modern life and innovation (MoMA 2021). Abstracted geometric forms allow multiple readings, reflecting the machine's physicality and symbolic value in the modern world.</p>

			<p>Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) marked a point in Cubism. The subject, distorted figures, more explicitly the women from the brothel, whose figure is reduced to geometric forms (MoMA 2021). African art and Iberian sculpture influence come across in mask-like faces that violate traditional ideals of beauty and womanhood (MoMA 2021). The painting instigated a complete revolution from its traditional representations of the female nude, embracing abstraction and multiple visions.</p>

			<p>Picasso’s Girl with a Mandolin (1910) is a key example of Synthetic Cubism. Picasso transforms Analytical Cubism complexity into discrete shapes by incorporating textures from collage techniques in this work (MoMA 2021). The painting shows Cubist interest in synthesis since it harmoniously unites the figure with the environment. The artwork's design progression shows how abstract fragmentation evolved into a more unified, graceful composition.</p>

			<p>Lipchitz’s Man with a Guitar (1915) offers a sculptural interpretation of Cubism. Lipchitz presents a man playing guitar using broken planes and geometric components, stimulating viewers to view the sculpture from different positions (MoMA 2021). The artist achieved three-dimensional Cubist art by extending this revolutionary movement to sculptural expression.</p>
