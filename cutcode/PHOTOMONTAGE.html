	<h2>PHOTOMONTAGE</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="txt">Photomontage, widely used during the early 20th century, was the popular technique of the Dada and Surrealism movements. Photomontage is a technique where parts of photographs are cropped, rearranged, and assembled in new compositions, which is mostly alien to the traditional rules of art (MoMA 2021). In this way, the artists challenged political powers, social and gender norms, and multiple world representations.</p>

			<p>The perfect example of how Dadaists used photomontage to subvert religious and social ideologies is Johannes Baader's The Author of the Book Fourteen Letters of Christ in his Home (1920) (MoMA 2021). The traditional depictions of spirituality are juxtaposed with Baader’s fragmented imagery of religious symbols, figures and abstract shapes (MoMA 2021). Just as Dada attempted to smash the norms in the visual culture rapidly emerging at the time, it’s a refusal of image and authority, this in a certain sense is the same. The fragmented narrative caused by broken composition makes the drawing of the narrative difficult and calls into the question the facts.</p>

			<p>Hannah Höch’s Indian Dancer: From an Ethnographic Museum (1930) critiques colonial representations and the commodification of non-Western cultures (Höch & Boswell 1996, 1). Höch can juxtapose European female imagery with ethnographic museum items by using the photomontage technique, ultimately presenting Western views of the 'other' through its objectifying gaze (MoMA 2021). As the document notes, “Höch’s photomontages from the 1920s focused almost exclusively on issues relating to the construction of women's identity and gender relationships, and did so with a detached irony that contrasts sharply with Berlin Dada's exuberant egotism” (Höch & Boswell 1996, 1). The fragmented images in her work expose the cultural biases inherent in colonialist ideologies and challenge the viewer’s understanding of identity (MoMA 2021; Höch & Boswell 1996).</p>

			<p>László Moholy-Nagy's The Law of Series (1925) is just one example of how photomontage was utilized to explore the relationship between order and disorder (MoMA 2021). Moholy-Nagy, a key figure in the Bauhaus school, used photomontage to blur differences between structured sequences and unstructured randomness (MoMA 2021). The work utilizes recognizable and abstract images, challenging the viewer to reconsider assumptions regarding structure and randomness. The use of geometric patterns in the photomontage signifies a scientific process, but the broken-up composition resists that orderliness, forcing the viewer to wonder how reality must be organized.</p>

			<p>Grete Stern’s Dream No. 1: Electrical Appliances for the Home (1949) critiques the role of technology and gender roles in post-war society. The artwork shows surreal elements to illustrate a woman's nighttime visions about domestic appliances and implies that home spaces limit women's freedom (MoMA 2021). Stern uses photomontage techniques to show how post-war consumerism affected women psychologically and transformed their identities. The fragmented visual elements represent the fragmented experience of modern times, when personal matters tend to merge with political realities.</p>

			<p>Romare Bearden's Train Whistle Blues No. 1 (1964) represents the African American experience and examines migration, identity, and remembrance. Bearden employs photographs and sketches to represent the movement, with the train employed as a metaphor for escape and change (MoMA 2021). Photomontage as a process allows Bearden to create a composite of remembrance and emotion, the brokenness of which reflects the fractured state of identity and the aspiration of belonging. From pieces like Höch's, Baader's, and Bearden's, photomontage continues to be a powerful tool for negotiating the complexity of the modern world and undermining the representation that characterizes our common knowledge.</p>
