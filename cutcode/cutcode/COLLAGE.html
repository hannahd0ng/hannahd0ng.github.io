	<h2>COLLAGE</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="txt">As a transformative art form, collage transcends mere technique to become a philosophy of fragmentation and reconstruction, reflecting the disjointedness of modern experience (Onibere 2024, 4). From its Cubist origins in glued paper to today’s digital permutations, collage has evolved into a versatile medium for artistic expression, political resistance, and cultural reflection. “…collage has challenged traditional notions of representation, composition, and artistic materials, leaving a lasting imprint on the art world” (Onibere 2024, 4).</p>

			<p>Bruce Nauman’s Fist in Mouth (1990) exemplifies how collage can engage with psychological and social themes. Nauman creates a visual composition through images and text to examine the confusing bond between body and mind. Through this artwork, Nauman shows a fist inside a mouth to display power dynamics that challenge viewers about their control of their body and words (MoMA 2021). The conflicting materials generate tension, which makes the audience face unsettling physical-mental restriction dynamics.</p>

			<p>Max Ernst's Butterflies (1931) is another large painting that uses collage to address dreamlike and surrealist visions. Ernst recycles fragments of drawings and photographs to create an alien, almost fantastic image (MoMA 2021). The transformation of butterflies into surreal, elongated creatures demonstrates Ernst's fascination with the unconscious mind and the Surrealist investigation of dreams and desires. The collage technique allows him to have fun with the photographs, introduce a foul tension between the apparent and the actual, and strip the richness of human sight.</p>

			<p>Kurt Schwitters' Untitled (Mz ELIKAN ELIKAN ELIKAN) (c. 1925) is a Dadaist collage technique whereby found material and text are employed in the creation of anti-art and meaningless statements (MoMA 2021). Schwitters' use of everyday material, such as advertisements and fragments of text, in his art questions conventional approaches to art (MoMA 2021). The cyclical and repetitive nature of the work and chaotic organization of the objects force the observer to look more deeply at the work, alluding to the absurdity of modern life.</p>

			<p>Joseph Cornell's Allegory of Innocence (1956) looks at the idea of collage in creating intimate and close narratives. Cornell was known for his box constructions and assemblages, and in this work, he uses images, found objects and miniature models to create a diorama like environment (MoMA 2021). Collages and shadow boxes have an aura of loss and nostalgia, and the viewer is made to explore the emotions of childhood and innocence. The combination of materials in Cornell's work creates a fragmented identity and memory.</p>

			<p>In Yo Mama (2003), Wangechi Mutu brings collage into the modern age and uses issues of identity, gender, and cultural appropriation. Collaging cut-up pieces from various sources, such as magazines, advertisements, medical texts, etc., Mutu creates an image of a strong, twisted female form (MoMA 2021). Through collage, the piece subverts the body representation and the viewers’ understanding of race, gender, and power.</p>
