		<h2>Onibere, Victor. "Evolution of Collage as a Medium and Its Influence on Modern Art." (2024): 1-5.</h2>
		<p>The article gives a wide look at how collage became a revolutionary art medium at the time of its emergence. In addition to tracing the evolution of collage from its early use by Picasso and Braque to its use today, as seen in digital art and beyond, Onibere shows how collage moved from being a subversive form of expression to an established art technique. In the piece, they emphasize the importance of collage in testing the boundaries of traditional art by using found materials and collaging, a practice that breaks down representation. It describes how the collage medium's cut-and-paste nature corresponds to the fragmented realities of modern life. He also looks at the political and social ramifications of collage by artists using the medium to challenge social structures and norms. This article is a great go-to article for some basic understanding of how collage is an essential tool for modern artists and, therefore, is vital for current practice. It lays the foundation for broadening the aperture of how collage is perceived in art.</p>
