		<h2>"Cubism." The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Accessed March 2025. https://www.metmuseum.org/learn/<br>curriculum-resources/cubism.</h2>
		<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art provides an insightful overview of Cubism, including its relationship with collage. Cubism was one of the most important movements of the 20th century, overthrowing the world of art with collage techniques that chopped up and reassembled visual reality. In their paintings, collage is developed by artists such as Picasso and Braque, incorporating elements of newspapers, wallpaper, and other everyday materials. The museum's resource explains how collage in Cubism enabled artists to experiment with multiple views simultaneously, demonstrating how one subject could be represented from numerous disparate viewpoints saved in a single, finished work of art. It was a very radical break from traditional portraiture and landscape painting. Understanding the broader transformation in art during the early 20th century would not be possible without discussing the influence of Cubism on collage. This is a vital resource for anyone looking into the historical context of collage about the growth of Cubism and wider avant-garde movements.</p>
